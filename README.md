❗ Issue with News API (Error 426 - Upgrade Required)
You may encounter a 426 (Upgrade Required) error when trying to fetch news articles.

🔹 Why is this Happening?
NewsAPI.org has restricted free-tier API keys from being used on public hosting platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, and similar services. While the API works fine locally, it fails when deployed online.

🔹 Suggested Solution
Since using the API online requires a paid plan, which was not feasible, I recommend running the project locally to fetch news successfully.
