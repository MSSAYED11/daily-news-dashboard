in this also explain the below thing. Also explain that i tried of other api's but still i was facing the same problem so suggest to run the code in local

The 426 (Upgrade Required) error means that NewsAPI now requires an upgraded (paid) plan to access their API from certain environments (like GitHub Pages).

🔹 Why is this Happening?
NewsAPI.org blocks free-tier API keys from being used on GitHub Pages, Netlify, and other public hosting services.
The API works locally but fails when deployed.
